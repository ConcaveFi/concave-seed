# pCNV to CNV mechanics
    ---------------------
    The contract features two vesting schedules to redeem pCNV into CNV.
    Both schedules are linear, and have a duration of 2 years.

    The first vesting schedule determines how many pCNV a holder can redeem at
    any point in time. At contract inception - 0% of a holder's pCNV can be 
    redeemed. At the end of 2 years, 100% of a holder's pCNV can be redeemed.
    It goes from 0% to 100% in a linear fashion.

    The second vesting schedule determines the percent of CNV supply that pCNV
    corresponds to. This vesting schedule also begins at 0% on day one, and
    advances linearly to reach 10% at the end of year two.

    The following is a breakdown of a pCNV to CNV redemption:

    Assumptions:
        - Alice holds 100 pCNV
        - pCNV total supply is 200
        - CNV total supply is 1000
        - 1 year has passed and Alice has not made any previous redemptions
    
    Then:
        - The first vesting schedule tells us that users may redeem 50% of their
          holdings, so Alice may redeem 50 pCNV.
        - The second vesting schedule tells us that pCNV total supply corresponds
          to 5% of total CNV supply.
        - Since total CNV supply is 1000, 5% of it is 50, so 50 CNV are what
          correspond to the 200 pCNV supply.
        - Alice has 50% of total pCNV supply
        - Thus, Alice is entitled to 50% of the claimable CNV supply, i.e Alice
          is entitled to 25 CNV

    Conclusion:
        - Alice burns 50 pCNV
        - Alice mints 25 CNV

Here's an example on how to use the "Contract Interaction" feature to interact with arbitrary smart contracts. You can access the Contract Interaction feature using the Send button.

1) Select a smart contract to interact with
First, you need to paste a valid Ethereum address of a smart contract that you would like to interact with.

2) Specify the ABI
For contracts that are verified on Etherscan, we automatically suggest the ABI, but you can also add an ABI manually using the input field.

3) Select the method
You can now select one of the available methods for this contract. Gnosis Safe supports both, read and write functions.

4) Define parameter
The interface will now display the parameters and parameter types of this method. Optional: Define how much ETH is being sent with this contract interaction in the Value input field.

5) Review and send
Finally, you can review your smart contract interaction and confirm the transaction. Depending on your owner setup, the transaction will have to be confirmed by other signers as well.
